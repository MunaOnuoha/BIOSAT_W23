## Module Description 
This module is used to teach data analysis through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means on a data set of land use in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, and New Hampshire, and basic weather data, White-Tailed Deer Population, and the incidence of Lyme disease. Students are introduced to the data set and the goals of analysis in the pre-lab, and then are walked through the data in table format, map format, and PCA and k-means plots in the main lab assignment. These plots are interactively produced through the use of a Google Colab file running python script. The lab and pre-lab assignments are Canvas quizzes which live in Canvas Commons.

## Folder Structure

The folder *completed_module* contains all of the module components.  

The *components* subfolder contains the pre-lab and lab assignments and the Colab file itself. The pre-lab and lab live in Canvas commons so they are stored here as readme files with links to commons. The Colab should be downloaded and then reuploaded to a google drive for hosting.

The *data* subfolder contains the JSON format shapefiles for creating the maps and the CSV data set for analysis. The CSV can be downloaded directly and opened in Excel for additional analysis. The data files *should not be moved* because their locations are coded into the Colab for access. If they are moved or ajusted, the Colab access links must be changed accordingly.

The *logistics* subfolder contains ...
