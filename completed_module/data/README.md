# Data Files

This folder contains all of the data used in the module. **These files should not be moved because their locations are hard-coded into the Colab for access.**

1. The JSON files folder contains the JSON format shapefiles that outline the counties in MA, MD, NH, and CT (MA is mislabeled as "MS"). These are used to make the maps in Colab.
2. The .csv file contains the CSV format data set including land-use percentages, weather, white-tailed deer population estimate, and lyme disease incidence. You may wish to download this file for additional analysis in Excel (e.g. you can show your students the results of a multi-variable regression test instead of PCA and K-means like the Colab does if you or your students are interested).
